Artwork Story:<br/>
My name is Terleaha Williams. I am a proud Kamilaroi and Yuin woman raised in Mount Druitt. I created this piece for the Mounty&#160;<br/>
Yarns program. A program that I am truly passionate about.<br/>
The painting represents us as the Aboriginal young people of Mount Druitt, walking beside our community, as we navigate&#160;<br/>
systems that have remained harmful to our people and community for many generations.<br/>
We are meeting to listen and yarn. We are acknowledging traditional practices passed down to us whilst drawing on our own&#160;<br/>
lived experiences to shape and deliver new frameworks led by us, for us.<br/>

Aboriginal young people in Mount Druitt<br/>Mount Druitt is our home. We are all from different areas, tribes and families. Mount Druitt is a caring, loving, supportive&#160;<br/>
community that comes together in times of need. There are heaps of blackfellas, everyone knows everyone. We have some hectic&#160;<br/>
memories around here that you couldn’t lose in your brain even if you wanted to. If you could get a projector in some of our ears&#160;<br/>
and you could see, we’d be here all day laughing in stitches.&#160;<br/>
The young people of Mounty are loyal, passionate, talented, caring and love to have a laugh. We all grew up going through the&#160;<br/>
same toxic situations as kids, that is this glue stuck to all of us and kept us together no matter what. We can’t stress how much this&#160;<br/>
is a family, and how much we love our brothers and sisters. There were some shitty situations that always come up that we couldn’t&#160;<br/>
have helped if we tried to, it’s just unfair situations that we just took with both hands and ran with it, and we’re just overcoming it.&#160;<br/>
We love and value our culture and our Elders. We recognise that without the resistance and leadership from our old ones that we&#160;<br/>
would not be in a position to speak up and make change. We are willing and proud to take up their fight. Despite our people’s&#160;<br/>
longstanding fight for self-determination and land rights, we are still at the mercy of a system that is afraid of us. A system that has&#160;<br/>
traumatised our grandparents, parents, and now us. A system so afraid that it keeps 10-year-old children locked behind barbed&#160;<br/>
wire, controls their contact with family, and repeatedly strip-searches them. The truth is that it is Aboriginal children and young&#160;<br/>
people who should be afraid.&#160;<br/>
We grow up expecting bad things to happen to us.<br/>
We don’t want the next&#160;<br/>
We worry that things won’t change, so we are going to change them.&#160;<br/>
People from Mount Druitt are always labelled. We are all so proud to&#160;<br/>
generation to go through what&#160;<br/>
be from this community. We want to create our solutions, and though&#160;<br/>
we know it’s not going to be easy, we are committed to building a&#160;<br/>
we went through. We want to be&#160;<br/>
better future for our families and communities.<br/>
a voice so others don’t have to&#160;<br/>
We want to tell young people that you need to talk up and tell&#160;<br/>
keep repeating their stories. We&#160;<br/>
people where you want to see change in your community. That’s&#160;<br/>
need to make sure young fullas’&#160;<br/>
what we’ve been doing, because we’re sick of seeing all our brothers,&#160;<br/>
cousins, aunties and uncles coming in and out of jail all the time. If&#160;<br/>
voices are being heard now.”<br/>
you want change around here, just never be scared to speak up.&#160;<br/>

CALL TO ACTION<br/><b>As a community and as young people, we know what works for us. Solutions need a strong focus&#160;</b><br/>
<b>on self-determination, investing in young people, and changing the way other people look at young&#160;</b><br/>
<b>people in Mount Druitt.&#160;</b><br/>
<b>Solutions need to be centred around youth and community leadership, with the goal of&#160;</b><br/>
<b>intergenerational change.</b><br/>
As Aboriginal young people we can tell you that the “Justice System” is not working, and is actually having a&#160;<br/>
devastating effect. Our young people need to know that we as a community care for them. The way systems&#160;<br/>
are set up at the moment, it is hard to tell. Nothing improves by locking up kids. When you do, you take us&#160;<br/>
away from everything we value – our family, our culture, our country.&#160;<br/>
Governments need to stop investing so much in police and prisons and start investing in young people, with&#160;<br/>
proper support to keep them away from the criminal justice system in the first place. We are strong advocates&#160;<br/>
for raising the age of criminal responsibility. As you read through the experiences of young people in Mount&#160;<br/>
Druitt and see how young we were when we were harassed, traumatised and brutalised by police, and&#160;<br/>
harmed by systems that didn’t support us, remember that no young person should be experiencing these&#160;<br/>
things.&#160;<br/>
We want everyone to be able to learn from the experiences, strengths, challenges and resilience of us as&#160;<br/>
young people. We speak for those young people who aren’t usually given a voice or listened to, young&#160;<br/>
people who are actively disbelieved.&#160;<br/>
<b>We share these yarns with you and ask that you listen and hear our truths.&#160;</b><br/>
<b>We hope that you hear our solutions and back us to make change.&#160;</b><br/>

WHAT NEEDS&#160;<br/>
TO CHANGE<br/>At&#160;their&#160;core, all of&#160;the ideas&#160;<br/>
that young Aboriginal people&#160;<br/>
came up with require&#160;these&#160;<br/>
pathways for&#160;change.<br/>

THE MOUNTY YARNS APPROACH<br/><b>We are just some of the strong Aboriginal young people&#160;</b><br/>
<b>Every young person had a traumatising story with the&#160;</b><br/>
<b>in Mount Druitt fighting for a better future for our young&#160;</b><br/>
<b>police. Too often those stories get laughed off and&#160;</b><br/>
<b>people. We want to build a better future for our families&#160;</b><br/>
<b>normalised.</b><br/>
<b>and communities. We want to build the solutions.</b><br/>
Young people told us that they wanted a short film to come&#160;<br/>
We, as Aboriginal young people with our own experiences&#160;<br/>
out of this work, so the Mounty Yarns film was created. The&#160;<br/>
of the impact of the criminal justice system, have gathered&#160;<br/>
report and film are for young people to use as advocacy tools.&#160;<br/>
these stories and bring our own experiences of growing up&#160;<br/>
in Mount Druitt into this work. We have had one-on-one&#160;<br/>
yarns and yarning circles, run sessions in schools and youth&#160;<br/>
We didn’t wait for these advocacy tools to be finished,&#160;<br/>
justice centres. We have talked to our friends, families and&#160;<br/>
because we knew this work couldn’t wait. We have already&#160;<br/>
communities.&#160;<br/>
started leading change. We have partnered with organisations.&#160;<br/>
Our OzTag program has been a key part of the youth&#160;<br/>
We are talking to and hearing from the young people who&#160;<br/>
engagement for Mounty Yarns. Young people also asked for&#160;<br/>
many say, “you can’t engage with”. Many of those young&#160;<br/>
a music program which is up and running; the stories told&#160;<br/>
people are now involved in leading this work. We’ve talked&#160;<br/>
through our music is an important part of how we can listen to&#160;<br/>
to almost 100 young people. Their ages range from 6 years&#160;<br/>
young people’s experiences.<br/>
old to 26 years old, with the majority of in-depth contributors&#160;<br/>
being between the ages of 15-23. 12 young people have&#160;<br/>
taken up lead roles in this work. With the right support and&#160;<br/>
We have also been advocating for our community. We have&#160;<br/>
trust in place, young people do want to be involved, share&#160;<br/>
sat down with the Executive Director of Youth Justice and&#160;<br/>
their knowledge and that they care deeply.<br/>
the Advocate for Children and Young People. We have&#160;<br/>
presented at conferences and published articles. We have&#160;<br/>
The young people we talked to, and who have led this work,&#160;<br/>
met with academics, with community members, with service&#160;<br/>
have experiences of being in foster care, being suspended&#160;<br/>
providers, and with the National Children’s Commissioner of&#160;<br/>
and excluded from multiple schools, and of being in and out&#160;<br/>
the Australian Human Rights Commission. We’ve advocated&#160;<br/>
of custody during this project. We have repeatedly been let&#160;<br/>
for our peers at court and in meetings with police. We’ve met&#160;<br/>
down by services and broken government systems.&#160;<br/>
with corporates and philanthropists to ask for flexible and&#160;<br/>
responsive funding for things that young people want.<br/>

<b>We are showing that what works is young people leading&#160;</b><br/>

Endorsement of&#160;<br/>
Young people trust us because we have been through what&#160;<br/>
Mounty Yarns<br/>
they have and they can see us making change.&#160;<br/>
We couldn’t include every yarn, every idea, but this is just the&#160;<br/>
We’ve spoken to our Elders and community&#160;<br/>
beginning. We are going to keep yarning, advocating and&#160;<br/>
leaders who want young people like us to lead&#160;<br/>
making change.&#160;<br/>
and will back us to make change. They include:<br/>

•&#160;&#160;Aunty Lizzie May<br/>
shared learnings.<br/>
&#160;<br/>Each of the short stories in the Mounty Yarns report is made&#160;<br/>
up of stories that we heard again and again, and that we had&#160;<br/>
experienced too. These stories have been de-identified and&#160;<br/>
young people have had final say over what goes in the report.&#160;<br/>

Just the usual<br/>
It was a sunny afternoon at Whalan Reserve and we were passing the ball around getting ready&#160;<br/>
for the game. We were laughing and mucking around, everyone was geed because we were in&#160;<br/>
the semis for OzTag. We finished and started walking to the shops to grab a feed. As&#160;we were&#160;<br/>
walking down the street we saw the coppers and we just all started running.<br/>
Because we know, for us, there are no good interactions with police.&#160;<br/>
...FOR US, THERE ARE NO&#160;<br/>
GOOD INTERACTIONS WITH&#160;<br/>
POLICE.”<br/>

<img src="output-13_2.png"/><br/>
I can’t even walk down the street<br/>
I started running home, my heart pounding in my chest as my&#160;feet hit the pavement. It was fight or flight. We hate them. And they&#160;<br/>
hate us. It’s always been like that. The tension between the police and our community never stops. It only gets worse.&#160;<br/>
The first time I was assaulted by police, I was only eight or nine years old. I was with a couple of mates and we used to just&#160;walk&#160;<br/>
around, hang around shops - Whalan shops - and every time we would see a copper we would just run, or they’d just pull us over&#160;<br/>
and harass us, like they always do. One time, there were two coppers, they chased us, and my older brothers got away, but I was&#160;<br/>
young back then, and one copper, he caught me. He pushed me to the ground and hit me on the back of the head with a bat. I&#160;<br/>
had a split in the back of my head. I still have the scar.<br/>
We all have a story, and the anger and trauma lasts for so long. A copper walks up to me and I just feel anger all over my body.&#160;<br/>
Anytime we are anywhere we have our escape routes planned in case we need to run. We can’t even walk down the street without&#160;<br/>
being harassed. We are scared. Just because we know what the outcome is going to be like.<br/>
So I run.<br/>
I grew up here so I hit the back lanes. I could hear them put on&#160;<br/>
the sirens and knew they were chasing us. When I looked over my&#160;<br/>
ANYTIME WE ARE&#160;<br/>
shoulder, I could see my cousin was running the same way as me.&#160;<br/>
The other boys must have cut in different directions. That’s good&#160;<br/>
ANYWHERE WE HAVE OUR&#160;<br/>
because it gives us a better chance.<br/>
ESCAPE ROUTES PLANNED&#160;<br/>
Then, out of nowhere, a car came out of the street and they&#160;<br/>
tried to run us over when we ran down that way. The car was just&#160;<br/>
IN CASE WE NEED TO RUN.”<br/>
straight behind us, speeding up on us. Boom.<br/>

<a name=14></a><img src="output-14_1.png"/><br/>
<img src="output-14_2.png"/><br/>
<img src="output-14_3.jpg"/><br/>
They got my cousin, so I went back and was tackled by some big&#160;<br/>
bloke. He hit me a few times while I was down. I yelled at him&#160;<br/>
WHENEVER POLICE SEE&#160;<br/>
that we haven’t done anything wrong, and he said, “Why did you&#160;<br/>
run from us then?&#160;<b>You were lucky we didn’t shoot you.”</b><br/>
ME, THEY JUST SEE A&#160;<br/>
They put me at the back of the car because there are cameras&#160;<br/>
SUSPECT.”<br/>
at the front. As soon as I gave them my name, they started&#160;<br/>
asking me about my family and who I am related to. Coppers&#160;<br/>
just assume, like once they hear our last name, they just assume&#160;<br/>
that we are getting into trouble or we’re up to no good. They&#160;<br/>
never ask about how good anyone is doing, it’s always just an&#160;<br/>
interrogation.&#160;<b>There’s a target on your back because of your&#160;</b><br/>
<b>family name.</b><br/>
It’s hard to believe that these cops are only trained for 8 months&#160;<br/>
at the Academy, and they end up with all this power. Power to&#160;<br/>
traumatise, affect our lives forever. Power to be believed over us.&#160;<br/>
I was let go as I had done nothing wrong but run. I get stopped&#160;<br/>
whether I run or not. Whenever police see me, they just see a&#160;<br/>
suspect. It leaves you with a sense of distrust, and you start to&#160;<br/>
feel down about yourself as to why you are treated poorly by&#160;<br/>
them when you’ve done nothing wrong to begin with.<br/>
As&#160;I&#160;walked&#160;home&#160;my&#160;whole&#160;body&#160;was&#160;shaking&#160;but&#160;I&#160;kept&#160;my&#160;eyes&#160;<br/>
darting because I know if another cop car sees me I’ll be running&#160;<br/>
again.&#160;<br/>

Another overnighter<br/>
I spoke to the Aboriginal Legal Service on the phone and&#160;<br/>
they told me to say nothing. Last time I got bail because my&#160;<br/>
youth worker heard from one of my friends I was in the cells.&#160;<br/>
I didn’t even reach around the corner before they had me&#160;<br/>
She showed up and knew the system better than the gunjies*.&#160;<br/>
laying on the ground in cuffs, thrown in the back of a paddy&#160;<br/>
They put really strict bail conditions that I couldn’t follow but&#160;<br/>
wagon. I knew I’d get bail refused, I have been every time&#160;<br/>
my youth worker helped get it listed at court and got them&#160;<br/>
since I turned 10. I’m 13 now. Every time I don’t get bail from&#160;<br/>
changed nearly straight away.&#160;<br/>
the cops, the Magistrate at court the next day says I should of&#160;<br/>
got bail.&#160;<br/>
I’ve had a lot of shit bail conditions, like once I had to report&#160;<br/>
to Mount Druitt police but was living in Parramatta and I got&#160;<br/>
I heard my friends yelling “which station are you taking him&#160;<br/>
fines just going to report. Even this time, that non-association&#160;<br/>
to?” We always try to make sure that someone knows where&#160;<br/>
was with a cousin I was living with, where I was bailed to&#160;<br/>
we are to help keep us safe. In the past the police haven’t&#160;<br/>
at the time, so I had to be there. I even had one that said I&#160;<br/>
even let me tell my Aunty when I was getting arrested - she&#160;<br/>
wasn’t allowed in Mount Druitt, when I was 11 years old. But&#160;<br/>
was in a house 15 metres away.&#160;<br/>
everyone I knew lived in Mount Druitt. No one was offering me&#160;<br/>
help to live somewhere else.<br/>
The police said there was reports of break and enters in the&#160;<br/>
area. Always the same excuse. &#160;When they looked up our&#160;<br/>
I gave them a few addresses and people’s places that I could&#160;<br/>
names, they see that me and my cousin have a non-association&#160;<br/>
of stayed at but they didn’t think it was suitable, so I ended up&#160;<br/>
order.<br/>
staying the night in a cell.&#160;<br/>
They put me in the fishtank at the station. The cells are so&#160;<br/>
small and everyone just stares at you. &#160;<br/>
*<i>police</i><br/>
The police say things to me, to get me to bite back at them.&#160;<br/>
Real racist things.&#160;<br/>
They tried to ring my carer but they didn’t answer. No one&#160;<br/>
THE POLICE SAY THINGS TO ME,&#160;<br/>
came for me. The person in the cell next to me was on ice.&#160;<br/>
The police tried to get me to sign something to get bail and&#160;<br/>
TO GET ME TO BITE BACK AT&#160;<br/>
made me say I’d go to PCYC. I don’t trust the PCYC. It’s run by&#160;<br/>
cops. They are always asking me questions about my brothers&#160;<br/>
if I go there.&#160;<br/>
THEM. REAL RACIST THINGS.”<br/>

<a name=17></a>Here we go again, same shit every day<br/>
Finally on the truck. Today is the day. I have been waiting for six months on remand. I am going for bail today and my lawyer&#160;<br/>
reckons I got a good chance. I am excited it will be Youth Koori Court too.<br/>
I remember the first time I went to Cobham, I was so scared. A thousand things were going through my mind.&#160;<b>Getting strip&#160;</b><br/>
<b>searched, it feels like all your dignity gets left there.</b>&#160;I never felt more scared and powerless. You never really get over that&#160;<br/>
feeling or get used to it. But it happens a lot. I felt sick getting strip searched from the cops and then at Cobham again.&#160;<br/>
They don’t tell you nothing. They all think you’ve been there, done it before. I didn’t even know how to use the radio or TV. I had&#160;<br/>
to bang on the door and ask the lady how to do it.<br/>
That feels like so long ago, been doing the same routine every day since. I wake up same time, same breakfast, same chores,&#160;<br/>
muster, and go to bed at the same time every day. It even feels like they drag out the whole meal routine, eat, sweep, mop, wipe&#160;<br/>
the benches, so you barely have any time outside of your cell. Even if you’ve finished&#160;your meal in five minutes, you still have to&#160;<br/>
wait for the whole routine. They don’t give you a proper chance, they want you to get institutionalised right away.<br/>
Being locked up, being away from family, having anxiety, and being locked up in small spaces and stuff, it messes with you&#160;<br/>
mentally. Messes with your head, being in environments like that. You overthink stuff. Think of bad stuff. When I’m always by&#160;<br/>
myself, a lot of stuff gets to me.&#160;<br/>
It helped to speak to an Elder and some Aboriginal workers. I felt comfortable talking to Elders, you know, one of our Elders that’s&#160;<br/>
like you. Haven’t been able to yarn to an Elder for a few weeks though. There’s so many of us Aboriginal kids in here, it’s hard to&#160;<br/>
get to all of us.&#160;<br/>
I swear they write you up for shitty little things. Writeups get held against you. I hope they don’t bring them up in court today. My&#160;<br/>
last one was for singing in the shower. I feel they purposely do it and it’s so dependent on their mood coming into work. If they&#160;<br/>
are in a bad mood, they don’t care about you. They’ll write you up, put you in your room, they don’t care. Just when I start going&#160;<br/>
good, boom another writeup. This place isn’t about helping, it’s all about earning your points. That’s what they try to do, bribe you&#160;<br/>
to get points, like if you don’t go to school, you don’t earn your points. You miss two points, you lose your TV.<br/>
&#160;MOUNTY YARNS &#160; 17<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=18></a><img class="yflip" src="output-18_1.jpg"/><br/>
And you can’t complain about the writeups either. You get targeted if you complain. You can’t get through to&#160;<br/>
the Ombo*. I tried 23 times in one day before I got through or it just goes to the Centre Manager and you&#160;<br/>
get targeted. So who do we complain to about the Ombo? The boys complain to the Official Visitors about&#160;<br/>
the food quality but it doesn’t change, even though she’s good. Complaints take so long. We wanted to get&#160;<br/>
cutlery. Even that didn’t work. Complaints go nowhere.<br/>
I used to have dreams that I would break out of my room, and like, run down to admissions and get all my stuff&#160;<br/>
and walk out of the Centre. It’s just being in that environment and having it in your thoughts, you go to sleep&#160;<br/>
thinking of it and you just dream about it. Everyone does.<br/>
I grew up without an identity. I didn’t know who my family was. And being in juvie tipped me over. Seeing my&#160;<br/>
brothers leaving and coming back again. We are all so stuck in the system. Being an inmate was becoming my&#160;<br/>
identity. They make it so hard for family to visit, it’s almost like they want to keep you apart from them. Even to&#160;<br/>
get them on your dial list takes so long. It can take up to three months to get calls or visits. It depends on your&#160;<br/>
behaviour sometimes.&#160;<br/>
The last time I got out, I felt like the workers didn’t want me to succeed, no one helped me find&#160;<br/>
accommodation. I got out too late to go to a refuge, so a worker ended up paying for two nights in a hotel to&#160;<br/>
give me some space to find somewhere. I left custody without any photo ID, no licence, no working&#160;bank card.&#160;<br/>
I think a lot of people still don’t want me to succeed, but I learned about my culture this time and have started&#160;<br/>
piecing together my identity. The Aboriginal staff and Elders helped me a lot.&#160;<br/>
<b>But you shouldn’t have to go into custody to learn this stuff. It doesn’t feel like the right&#160;</b><br/>
<b>place to do it, but it’s the only way to connect to culture and do stuff. It’s the only chance&#160;</b><br/>
<b>you get.&#160;</b><br/>
I hope this time is different for me. As I get off the truck at court I see my brothers from Mounty getting off&#160;<br/>
too. They must of come in overnight. We give each other a nod and ask to be put in the cell underneath the&#160;<br/>
court together.&#160;<br/>

Where’s our support?<br/>
We’re both homeless and I was hoping that he could get&#160;<br/>
a place for us both. But there’s a waiting list for the service&#160;<br/>
that helps with that and then you get told the waiting list for&#160;<br/>
Wasn’t downstairs long before I went up to court. I’ve spent&#160;<br/>
housing in Mount Druitt is around 10-15 years wait. We’ve&#160;<br/>
so many hours waiting at this court. At least I got to see one&#160;<br/>
been homeless since we were removed and have stayed in&#160;<br/>
of the brothers downstairs that’s been away for a while. I got&#160;<br/>
so many abandoned houses and it still takes so long to get a&#160;<br/>
bail but got let out and there was no one there to support me.&#160;<br/>
place. No surprise that some of my older family end up in jail&#160;<br/>
There is never any support. The court kept trying to get me to&#160;<br/>
just to have a place to stay.<br/>
go to PCYC programs.&#160;<b>Everyone knows you can’t trust the&#160;</b><br/>
<b>police. The PCYC “engaged” with us but then they’d come&#160;</b><br/>
I’ve had like 15 FACS* caseworkers in two years. There’s no&#160;<br/>
<b>back and flog us, and use everything they learnt about us&#160;</b><br/>
support there. You learn their name and when you go to ring&#160;<br/>
<b>against us.</b>&#160;They know all our nicknames, I seen it in my briefs&#160;<br/>
them up they aren’t your caseworker anymore.&#160;<br/>
from the police.&#160;<br/>
<b>The brothers are my only support.&#160;</b><br/>
I wanted to stay out of trouble but it’s so boring. We done&#160;<br/>
dumb shit ‘cos there’s nothing to do around here. There’s no&#160;<br/>
I never knew I was entitled to anything because I grew up in&#160;<br/>
places to go and just hang out, especially after hours. That’s&#160;<br/>
and out of FACS. Most of my friends who grew up like me&#160;<br/>
when we really need stuff and support, outside of 9-5pm. Case&#160;<br/>
have no idea. A worker got me a “Leaving Care Plan”, and she&#160;<br/>
workers think they aren’t responsible or don’t care about us&#160;<br/>
had to follow up with my FACS worker every week until I got it.&#160;<br/>
after 5pm, they clock off.&#160;<br/>
Even then, I didn’t know how to access the money, and no one&#160;<br/>
was helping me.<br/>
<b>It don’t feel like my voice is heard.</b>&#160;There’s no support for&#160;<br/>
me. I pretty much have to beg for something. For me I don’t&#160;<br/>
That worker just left and now I don’t know who to ring. Maybe&#160;<br/>
like asking for help. We need more people who give a fuck&#160;<br/>
I’ll ask the lawyer the next time they lock me up.<br/>
and actually ask what we want and what’s really going on and&#160;<br/>
won’t arrest or remove us.<br/>

At least I’m still young. I look at my older brother and once&#160;<br/>

Taught us how to read&#160;&#160;us out of the school and out of the way. We know things about&#160;<br/>
surviving systems that they’ll never know. We knew then that&#160;<br/>
and white<br/>
if teachers didn’t care enough to try with us, then no one else&#160;<br/>
would.&#160;<br/>
As I left court I was mad. They gave me a bail condition to&#160;<br/>
It feels like no one ever listens to us at school. There needs to&#160;<br/>
go to school. I haven’t been at school in more than a year. I&#160;<br/>
be other options, not just forcing us to stay at school when it’s&#160;<br/>
was kicked out of mostly every school and now when I get&#160;<br/>
not working and teachers pick on you.<br/>
suspended I’m happy because I don’t have to go to school.&#160;<br/>
One of my cousins used to teach at the school. He was always&#160;<br/>
The teachers I’ve had are racist and called me “stupid”,&#160;<br/>
doing these programs, like Aboriginal programs, like dancing,&#160;<br/>
“ADHD”, “ODD”, “shit”. They said I was a “bad kid”.&#160;<b>It made&#160;</b><br/>
Koori dance and stuff. That was probably the only thing that I&#160;<br/>
<b>me feel dumb as hell.&#160;</b><br/>
was interested in at school, and having Elders and like having&#160;<br/>
cultural programs and stuff, during school hours. Learning&#160;<br/>
Teachers also targeted me and my friends and jumped to&#160;<br/>
about culture is what I was into. That’s what made me want&#160;<br/>
conclusions about us because of our last names.&#160;<br/>
to go to school, doing those kinds of programs. They mainly&#160;<br/>
happened in primary school though.<br/>
Teachers used to try and like raise their voice at me because&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
I didn’t know as much. And I used to get all defensive&#160;<br/>
I didn’t tell my lawyer that schools won’t take me because then&#160;<br/>
and angry, so then I would just swear at them and lose my&#160;<br/>
I might not get bail and have to stay in custody.&#160;<br/>
temper, and that’s most of the reasons why I got suspended.&#160;<br/>
Sometimes school let me come back for one hour a day, but I&#160;<br/>
didn’t really see the point in going for just one hour.<br/>
<b>I wish instead of just suspending me all the time, they&#160;</b><br/>
<b>could have helped me, because the more they suspended&#160;</b><br/>
WE KNEW THEN THAT IF&#160;<br/>
<b>me the more I didn’t care.</b><br/>
TEACHERS DIDN’T CARE&#160;<br/>
The teachers didn’t really know what to do with us, because&#160;<br/>
a lot of the time we didn’t even want to be there. But they&#160;<br/>
ENOUGH TO TRY WITH US,&#160;<br/>
didn’t really try to find out why we didn’t want to be there.&#160;<br/>
Instead of sitting down and actually talking to us and trying to&#160;<br/>
understand where we were coming from, they would try to get&#160;<br/>
THEN NO ONE ELSE WOULD.”<br/>

Retelling your trauma, for what?<br/>
I’m late for my appointment. It took so long for my adrenaline to come down last night after we copped that chase but I smoked&#160;<br/>
‘em. I’m stressing, because I have to go all the way into Parramatta to meet this counsellor that the court said I had to do. Lucky&#160;<br/>
my friend is coming with me.&#160;<br/>
I’ve been ordered to go there before. Got sat in this tiny room inside and the psych kept asking me to repeat my story over and&#160;<br/>
over again. Each time the court ordered me to go to a psych, I had to tell my story again, and again, and again. Nothing has&#160;<br/>
helped. I started using to numb the talk in my head. Then it wasn’t long until I was in Cobham.&#160;<br/>
In community there’s heaps of shame around it. I guess that’s why most of us end up in jail. That’s the sad truth. Like, a lot of the&#160;<br/>
boys don’t have anyone to talk to. So, they just do dumb things and end up in jail. Yeah that’s their version of Headspace, what I&#160;<br/>
know about mental health is jail. We don’t get any help until we are in jail, then, it’s too late.&#160;<br/>
At Cobham I went to the psychologist. I didn’t want to be there, but I had to otherwise I would lose points. I couldn’t really&#160;<br/>
understand her properly. And she was just making me angry. She kept telling me there were things wrong with me and how I&#160;<br/>
should change, nothing about how the system is fucked.&#160;<br/>
We are all carrying so much of our own stuff, such&#160;<br/>
heavy burdens, but also all of the stuff that our&#160;<br/>
families went through and the impacts of racism that&#160;<br/>
we experience from police, teachers, shop owners,&#160;<br/>
security, community members, every day. It’s huge. It&#160;<br/>
WE DON’T GET ANY HELP&#160;<br/>
weighs on us.&#160;<br/>
She was just pissing me right off so I just got up and&#160;<br/>
UNTIL WE ARE IN JAIL,&#160;<br/>
left. I felt judged, confused and rushed to talk, I’ve&#160;<br/>
already told my story to so many people, over and&#160;<br/>
THEN, IT’S TOO LATE.”<br/>
over. Why would I trust this lady who has no idea&#160;<br/>
where I come from?&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=25></a>I watched other kids go into custody normal-as, but they can’t handle being locked up and they get on the drugs like sleepers&#160;<br/>
and that and they full fry themselves hard, like they full change themselves forever. They do it to themselves or the screws do&#160;<br/>
it to them, to help control them they put them on the drugs. I didn’t want that to be me, so whenever they gave me tablets to&#160;<br/>
take I would trade them for chocolates and chips. I suppose on the inside and on the out, we just get fed drugs to deal with our&#160;<br/>
trauma, the main difference is who the dealer is.<br/>
It feels to us like the drug problem here in Mount Druitt is getting worse. The kids who are taking drugs are just getting younger&#160;<br/>
and younger, which just makes it more and more dangerous, more and more fucked. They’re young and do things without&#160;<br/>
thinking, or do things to impress the boys. Lots of the young people here act like it’s nothing, like they don’t have a problem.&#160;<br/>
They don’t see how it’s affecting them and their community.<br/>
We have nowhere to go, even if we do want to get clean or want help to stop drinking. If you go into custody you just get on&#160;<br/>
different drugs. There is only one Aboriginal alcohol and drug service near Mount Druitt and that’s for adults. They have helped&#160;<br/>
out my aunties and uncles. But they have different problems to us and if you’re a young person, you don’t want to sit around&#160;<br/>
with fully grown men and women talking about your problems.<br/>
Sometimes the best thing has been just being surrounded by the brothers, having a safe space to yarn.&#160;<b>For me, it was more&#160;</b><br/>
<b>the boys who were the people that actually listened to me, that I could tell things like maybe my mindset, my mental&#160;</b><br/>
<b>state and stuff, I could talk to the boys about it, tell ‘em how I’m feeling. But with other people it felt like they didn’t&#160;</b><br/>
<b>care or they just couldn’t be bothered listening. But with the boys, I feel like I could share anything with them.</b>&#160;I can’t&#160;<br/>
wait for the next game of OzTag so I can spin a yarn.&#160;<br/>
I can’t tell the court or anyone here that though. They would just laugh at me and think they know better for me. I just hope they&#160;<br/>
don’t lock me up.&#160;<br/>

Just another way to&#160;<br/>
on any other thing so they hit us for fines? That’s the only way&#160;<br/>
they’re going to get us. Or they want to ask about my family,&#160;<br/>
harass us<br/>
when my brother’s on the run. &#160;When they pull me over, there’s&#160;<br/>
always a question about where my brother is. It’s never, oh,&#160;<br/>
why are you on the road, walking across. The first question will&#160;<br/>
We are walking through Dawson Mall towards Mount Druitt&#160;<br/>
be, have you seen this fella, or have you been hanging around&#160;<br/>
Station and already feeling anxious because there’s never a&#160;<br/>
this group again?&#160;<br/>
day that the cops aren’t there. If my mate didn’t have to get to&#160;<br/>
Parra for some appointment and we weren’t running late we&#160;<br/>
I can’t afford the $200 fine. I have friends that have more than&#160;<br/>
would of walked to Rooty Hill to avoid ‘em. Do they seriously&#160;<br/>
$10,000 worth of fines. I only have $4000. It’s all fake money, it&#160;<br/>
not have anything better to do? I don’t have the money for a&#160;<br/>
only really affects you when you’re trying to get your life back&#160;<br/>
ticket but need to get to court. I’ll need to wait till they leave,&#160;<br/>
on track, when you want to get your licence and that.&#160;<br/>
I’m already so stressed out about court. I see another young&#160;<br/>
person try jump the barrier but there are cops on either side&#160;<br/>
I only know I got that much in fines from when I went to&#160;<br/>
and they get caught. I slip through the barrier while they are&#160;<br/>
the Youth Koori Court. One of the lawyers asked me some&#160;<br/>
distracted.&#160;<br/>
questions and I signed some stuff. Then they told me the&#160;<br/>
amount. I don’t think I will ever be able to pay it off because&#160;<br/>
I’m stressing on the train because I know I can still get fined&#160;<br/>
I keep getting new ones as I work off my old ones. When we&#160;<br/>
and because everyone is beefing and I don’t want to get&#160;<br/>
play OzTag one of the workers has it set up so that it works off&#160;<br/>
jumped. I hate this feeling, I get it every time I get on the train&#160;<br/>
our fines. If it wasn’t for that I don’t think I would ever get a&#160;<br/>
to report to my Youth Justice in Penrith too.&#160;&#160;<b>Every time I&#160;</b><br/>
licence. &#160;<br/>
<b>get pulled up by police, even if it’s just an Opal ticket, my&#160;</b><br/>

<b>what they’re gonna do.&#160;</b><br/>
..THEY GIVE ME ANOTHER&#160;<br/>
When I get off at the station for court the transit police are&#160;<br/>
waiting. They give me another fine, to add to my fines for not&#160;<br/>

wearing a helmet, riding a pushbike, walking across the road&#160;<br/>
with it, crossing when the light is red, you know, stupid things&#160;<br/>

Koori Court is probably&#160;&#160;At Youth Koori Court they actually give you a chance and listen&#160;<br/>
to you. They listen to what you have to say and how you feel.&#160;<br/>
the best thing I know<br/>
They actually sit down and talk about what’s going on for you,&#160;<br/>
so they can try and understand why you’ve ended up here.&#160;<b>It’s&#160;</b><br/>
<b>not just people deciding what’s best for you without even&#160;</b><br/>

really good. I’m even managing the boys OzTag team. One of&#160;<br/>
<b>and that they want to help you, not just lock you up.</b>&#160;It&#160;<br/>
the older fullas from the area started an OzTag team for us and&#160;<br/>
definitely helps, stuff actually gets done. In other courts they&#160;<br/>
a bunch of us in the Youth Koori Court play or work to support&#160;<br/>
just look at the charge and then look at you like that’s you.&#160;<br/>
it. I was worried last night when the police followed the OzTag&#160;<br/>
They only see one side.&#160;<br/>
bus to the boys’ houses but everyone was allowed to be out&#160;<br/>
for OzTag even if they had curfew or house arrest. Our worker&#160;<br/>
The Magistrate, she’s nice, and she wants to know about our&#160;<br/>
told them so, but the boys were still freaking out.&#160;<br/>
Aboriginal culture. She just wants to help us. Having an Elder&#160;<br/>
in there with you too, it makes a big difference. It makes you&#160;<br/>
I was so happy when I got accepted into the Youth Koori&#160;<br/>
feel more comfortable and it’s good for young Koori brothers&#160;<br/>
Court.&#160;<b>In Youth Koori Court they actually see the effort&#160;</b><br/>
and sisters to see an Elder in the courtroom. There should be&#160;<br/>
<b>you’re making, even the small things that feel big to you.</b>&#160;<br/>
more opportunities for young fellas to go through Koori court.&#160;<br/>
In normal court, they don’t care how long it’s been between&#160;<br/>
your offending.&#160;<br/>
They were all so excited when I told them about the OzTag&#160;<br/>
Final and one of the lawyers got me a cake. The Magistrate&#160;<br/>
When I first started getting locked up at the police station at&#160;<br/>
said she would come down and watch the Final even. One of&#160;<br/>
11, they told my mum that I had to have an offence and plead&#160;<br/>
my older cousins is hopefully getting out today too and he is a&#160;<br/>
guilty before she could get help with me. I could hear her on&#160;<br/>
weapon and is going to play with us.&#160;<br/>
the phone at night calling FACS for help even. Youth Koori&#160;<br/>
Court was how I got linked into a worker who I trusted. I spent&#160;<br/>
I walked out that court door hopefully for the last time. I just&#160;<br/>
a lot of time in custody before then though and got told to go&#160;<br/>
got to wait to sign the papers then finally I am free.&#160;<br/>
to some shit service.&#160;<br/>
As we walked in I saw my cousin waiting for normal court. I&#160;<br/>
feel bad for her because she isn’t on Youth Koori Court. I told&#160;<br/>
her about it and that she should go for it if she doesn’t beat&#160;<br/>
her charge.&#160;<br/>

Can’t hold us down<br/>
out of pity for us, but just ‘cos we were family and they didn’t&#160;<br/>
want to see any of the boys on the street or vice versa you&#160;<br/>
know.&#160;<br/>
It always feels weird being back here at court. This place&#160;<br/>
separated me from my family twice, first through the care&#160;<br/>
Us boys, we never had anyone telling us not to do something&#160;<br/>
system and then the justice system. But I am here today to&#160;<br/>
or to stay home, that there were other ways to have fun.&#160;<br/>
support one of the younger brothers who is getting out after&#160;<br/>
We started using, got in trouble, and ended up in custody.&#160;<br/>
going on a “little holiday”.&#160;<br/>
Imagine reconnecting with your blood brothers after being in&#160;<br/>
care for so long, and it’s in jail. All of my seven brothers were&#160;<br/>
I come from a big family, and at seven years old I was taken&#160;<br/>
once handcuffed at a funeral out on day leave. It used to be&#160;<br/>
from my family. They took me from school, and more than a&#160;<br/>
like a Mount Druitt reunion in there, with almost every unit full&#160;<br/>
decade later, I still can’t handle going near that school. We all&#160;<br/>
of us boys from Mount Druitt.<br/>
got taken to the principal’s office then they locked the door&#160;<br/>
and we never went home. The first time I went back to that&#160;<br/>
But the only reason why I know what I know is that I love the&#160;<br/>
suburb I was on a motorbike and I blacked out. It just brought&#160;<br/>
feeling, the brotherhood of our group of boys, and the sense&#160;<br/>
all the trauma rushing back.&#160;<br/>
of family. That connection helped me through some tough&#160;<br/>
times. As soon as I saw my boys, all my worries and problems&#160;<br/>
My dad was also taken from his family, and growing up, we&#160;<br/>
went away.<br/>
didn’t know much about who we were. Like I knew I was black&#160;<br/>
and from up the coast but that was about all.<br/>
I had an Aboriginal mentor who started visiting me before&#160;<br/>
I left custody and would take me for day trips. More young&#160;<br/>
I grew up in foster care, moving from one placement&#160;<br/>
people need people like him, people who aren’t “give up”&#160;<br/>
to another, spending time in kinship placements, foster&#160;<br/>
people.<br/>
care, and emergency accommodation. I never had stable&#160;<br/>
accommodation until I came into custody, where I finally had&#160;<br/>
a bed to sleep in and a three-course meal. I travelled all over&#160;<br/>
NSW with different people, and even when I had a good&#160;<br/>
IMAGINE RECONNECTING WITH&#160;<br/>
family, they weren’t mine, and they didn’t understand. I spent&#160;<br/>
most of my time with the boys because they were my family.<br/>
YOUR BLOOD BROTHERS AFTER&#160;<br/>
The brothers who had families, shared them. They never&#160;<br/>
BEING IN CARE FOR SO LONG,&#160;<br/>
pushed anyone away, they were always welcoming and&#160;<br/>
especially a couple of us boys who were with DOCS and on&#160;<br/>
AND IT’S IN JAIL.”<br/>
the streets, they gave us a place to stay, fed us and not just&#160;<br/>

So when I got out I wanted to do the same for my brothers&#160;<br/>
and sisters that those mentors and workers did for me. We&#160;<br/>
started to talk and plan for things we could do together to&#160;<br/>
WE STARTED MOUNTY&#160;<br/>
change our lives and our community. We started Mounty&#160;<br/>
Yarns, a safe place, because we’re all family, and we all go&#160;<br/>
YARNS, A SAFE PLACE,&#160;<br/>
through the same stuff and can relate to it. It’s a place where&#160;<br/>
you can come and be yourself, explain what your life is like&#160;<br/>
without being laughed at because we all feel the same way.&#160;<br/>
BECAUSE WE’RE ALL FAMILY...<br/>
It feels good to be around positive people, and we all do&#160;<br/>
something that’s good and it gets our minds off things. We&#160;<br/>
IT’S A PLACE WHERE&#160;<br/>
can all be ourselves around each other and express our&#160;<br/>
feelings. Because we are a family.<br/>
YOU CAN COME AND BE&#160;<br/>
One of the first things we did was create an Oz tag team. As&#160;<br/>
YOURSELF, EXPLAIN WHAT&#160;<br/>
kids, we would have big games, and the police would often&#160;<br/>
show up and give us Move Along Orders. The boys loved&#160;<br/>
YOUR LIFE IS LIKE WITHOUT&#160;<br/>
playing, so I came up with the idea to bring them together&#160;<br/>
for games and partner with services so that the police&#160;<br/>
BEING LAUGHED AT BECAUSE&#160;<br/>
couldn’t pick on us.<br/>
WE ALL FEEL THE SAME&#160;<br/>
We do the things young people ask us to do and now do&#160;<br/>
cultural days on Country, music workshops and a whole&#160;<br/>
WAY.”<br/>
bunch of things that young people tell us they want to do.&#160;<br/>
I am here at the court to tell them that and so it can all be&#160;<br/>
added to my younger brother’s support plan.&#160;<br/>
<b>Now that I have a child, I want their life to be nothing like&#160;</b><br/>
<b>what I went through, and I am working hard to make that&#160;</b><br/>
<b>a reality.&#160;</b>They will know their connection to Country and&#160;<br/>
Culture, grow up with their family, and always have a home&#160;<br/>
to go to with services that are ready to support them if they&#160;<br/>
need it.<br/>

OUR SOLUTIONS&#160;<b>Pathways for Change&#160;-&#160;<i>Mount Druitt is</i></b><br/>
<i><b>getting ready for a beautiful new beginning</b></i><br/>
Note: When we say “young people” we are referring to Aboriginal young people from Mount Druitt who have been involved in Mounty Yarns.<br/>
<i>“Mount Druitt’s home. Like you could ask anyone around&#160;</i><br/>
Although Mount Druitt continues to rank amongst the highest&#160;<br/>

in the state for youth crime per capita, Aboriginal young&#160;<br/>

to be free from harmful systems. They want to be free from&#160;<br/>
Aboriginal young people in Mount Druitt are strong, resilient,&#160;<br/>
over-policing and feeling like they have a target on their back&#160;<br/>
talented, and support each other and their community.<br/>
because of the colour of their skin or their family name. They&#160;<br/>
want to be free from the negative stereotypes and want to be&#160;<br/>
Aboriginal young people want to change the way other&#160;<br/>
treated as young people, not criminals.&#160;<br/>
people view young people in Mount Druitt. They want to&#160;<br/>
stand up and challenge the racism they face every day. They&#160;<br/>
They want the out-of-home-care system to stop tearing their&#160;<br/>
want people to understand what they experience in their&#160;<br/>
families apart and taking them away from their family, culture&#160;<br/>
everyday lives, the intergenerational challenges they face&#160;<br/>
and community. They want more safe and supported housing&#160;<br/>
and the strengths they can draw on from each other and their&#160;<br/>
options, because how is a young person supposed to stay out&#160;<br/>
community.&#160;<br/>

pre and post release support from custody, preferably from&#160;<br/>
The Yarns you just read reflect a number of the systemic&#160;<br/>

They want all the harmful systems that impact their lives to be&#160;<br/>
Greater investment in young people is needed; investment&#160;<br/>

Aboriginal young people in Mount Druitt want to feel valued&#160;<br/>
<i>“...not just the physical well-being of an individual but&#160;</i><br/>
and supported by the systems and services in their community.&#160;<br/>
<i>[referring] to the social, emotional and cultural well-being&#160;</i><br/>
They want to feel connected and proud of their culture,&#160;<br/>

<i>about the total well-being of their Community.”&#160;</i><br/>
who understand where they are coming from. They want a&#160;<br/>
safe place for all Aboriginal young people and their families&#160;<br/>
- National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health&#160;<br/>
to be able to access culturally safe support, not a PCYC run by&#160;<br/>
Organisation.<br/>
police. They want workers and services to be flexible in how&#160;<br/>
they work with young people, by working outside of 9am-5pm&#160;<br/>
Aboriginal young people deserve systems and services that&#160;<br/>
and having workers who care and who aren’t restrained by&#160;<br/>
support them and are responsive to what they need. They&#160;<br/>
strict criteria for giving support.&#160;<br/>
want to be able to trust and rely on other people and systems,&#160;<br/>
not only on each other.<br/>
They want their voices to be heard and their ideas for change&#160;<br/>
to be implemented, because who knows better about the&#160;<br/>
system than those who have lived it? Most of all, they want&#160;<br/>
a better future for themselves, their families, and their entire&#160;<br/>
community.&#160;<br/>
Aboriginal young people and their families want access to&#160;<br/>
culturally safe and trauma-informed services. Service providers&#160;<br/>
need to better understand the context of colonisation,&#160;<br/>
features of family/kin relationships, cultural load, cultural&#160;<br/>
understandings, the intergenerational impacts of colonisation&#160;<br/>
and social exclusion, as well as an Aboriginal definition of&#160;<br/>
mental health:<br/>

HOW TO BACK US<br/>The current punitive approach to criminal justice and youth offending is clearly not working. The way the criminal justice system&#160;<br/>
and the systems feeding it are currently set up, prioritises locking up a 10 year old rather than addressing the underlying drivers&#160;<br/>
of offending. To change this, a real investment in Aboriginal young people is needed and Aboriginal young people with lived&#160;<br/>
experience must be involved in decision making. People need to stop looking at Aboriginal young people as the problem, but&#160;<br/>
rather the solution.&#160;<br/>
In this section we highlight recommendations from Aboriginal young people with lived experience of the criminal justice system,&#160;<br/>
on what changes are needed to better support Aboriginal young people and the Mount Druitt community.&#160;<br/>
At the core of these recommendations are three fundamental shifts. Without these shifts in thinking and practices, young people&#160;<br/>
will continue to face systems that work against them:<br/>
<b>1.&#160;Self&#160;</b><br/>
<b>2.&#160;Stand&#160;</b><br/>
<b>3.&#160;Invest in&#160;</b><br/>
<b>Determination</b><br/>
<b>Against Racism</b><br/>
<b>Young People</b><br/>
Young people need&#160;<br/>
Change the way&#160;<br/>
Provide flexible and&#160;<br/>
and want to have<br/>
people look at<br/>
responsive funding&#160;<br/>
more of a role in&#160;<br/>
young people in&#160;<br/>
that meets young&#160;<br/>
decision making&#160;<br/>
Mount Druitt<br/>
people’s needs<br/>
It costs $1,956 per day, per person to keep a young person locked up. Imagine what this money could do if it was spent on&#160;<br/>
supporting young people and their families before they end up in prison.<br/>
